## Fibbonaci Sequence
<ul>
<li>This Algorithm will output the combination of the last two elements of a certain number in a sequential order from the smallest to the largest one.</li>
<li>The number must be different than 0.</li>
</ul>

## Hannoi Tower
<li>It's an algorithm to find the solution of the famous hannoi tower game using recursions.</li>

## KnapSack Problem
<li>This algorithm will solve the knapsack problem that requires to store elements into a limited sized inventory.The algorithm will add
the elements that have the highest profit out of them in the storage until there is no more space in the inventory.</li>
